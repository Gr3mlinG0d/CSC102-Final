    <h2> Program Objectives </h2>
    
<p>Technology Forensics Program Objectives 
   <ol>
        <li> Articulate the complexitites of network and application infrastructure and apply critical thinking skills to how they
            affect technology forensics investigations and incident response procedures. </li>  
        <li> Identify and apply in a forensics context the various topologies, standards, technologies and protocols employed in
            computer systems, including file system formats and their attributes. </li>    
        <li> Evaluate, select and deploy computer forensic measures for the response, mitigation and analysis of a security incident
            pertaining to digital artifacts and how information was compromised. </li>
        <li> Analyze and evaluate the current investigative and legal aspects of information and computer forensics, including
            electronic discovery, depositions, litigation and corporate personnel processes. </li>
        <li>  Evaluate and execute the strategies, methodologies, techniques and state-of-the-art forensics tools for the preservation of
            digital evidence on computer systems, network systems and other electronic devices. </li>
        <li> Create tracking processes to follow the trail of electronic evidence through digital systems, including documentation,
            formal reporting and presentation. </li>
   </ol>
    Network Engineering Program Objectives 
    <ol> 
        <li> Analyze the business needs of the organization while applying appropriate tools and frameworks to create solutions. </li>
        <li> Develop cloud infrastructure using appropriate orchestration tools that focus on emphasizing the best benefits of remote
            infrastructure. </li>
        <li> Integrate software development frameworks designed to exploit the horizontal scaling of cloud computing. </li>
        <li> Develop communication skills that facilitate the understanding of complex technology-related topics by laymen, as well
            as being able to provide technical writing when appropriate. </li>
        <li> Design communications environments that incorporate all facets of enterprise needs to include traditional networking but
            also account for needs and security within IoT, mobile devices, and integration of non-enterprise-owned devices. </li>
        <li> Develop all solutions with a security-first attitude while using best practices such as test-driven development. </li>
